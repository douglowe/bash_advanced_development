# Dev Repo for BASH Programming (Workflow Management)

This is the development repository for the BASH Programming for Workflow Management course.

Final organisation of the repo is currently undecided. My current thoughts are to have
a directory of example code per segment of the course (as expecting the students to go
through the development of all the code here is probably too much). The classes are:
1) variables and arrays
2) subshells and functions
3) BASH logic and maths
4) advanced loops (while)
6) sed and regex
7a) AWK?
7b) Crontab regular job scripting?
8) HPC batch scripting
9) Condor batch scripting
